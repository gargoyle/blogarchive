# Helidon SE Blog

This is an archive of a previous incarnation of [my personal blog](https://paulcourt.co.uk/). I'm uploading it here for reference, with the following disclaimer:-

**I use my personal blog as a playground, especially when I am experimenting with new technology, frameworks or libraries, etc. This code should be treated as such an experiment and I make no claims about its suitability for any given purpose.**

You're welcome to copy this code for your own use without any limitations. However, I strongly advise that you review it **ALL** very carefully.

## Technology

This blog makes use of the [Helidon SE framework](https://helidon.io/docs/v2/#/se/introduction/01_introduction) and the [Freemarker templating engine](https://freemarker.apache.org/).

It also includes a work around for [this issue](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/issues/2215) which is now well and truly redundant.
